    "judge": "3\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the summary based on the source article. Let me read the article carefully.\n\nThe article talks about Anders Lindegaard, a Manchester United goalkeeper who isn't playing much. He's married to Misse Beqiri, a Swedish model with Albanian roots. They got married in a beach wedding in Mauritius last year. They have a son together. Lindegaard posted on Instagram about spending a day off with his wife. Beqiri has over 17,000 Instagram followers and often posts modeling photos. Lindegaard has been at Manchester United since 2010 but has only made 19 league appearances. He's third-choice behind David de Gea and Victor Valdes. He was linked with a move to FC Midtjylland but nothing came of it.\n\nNow, looking at the summary:\n\n\"Anders lindegaard tied the swedish model last year in a romantic beach wedding.\"\n\nThis is correct. The article mentions he tied the knot with the Swedish model in Mauritius.\n\n\"The manchester united goalkeeper has made just 19 league appearances.\"\n\nThis is accurate. The article states he's made 19 league appearances in five seasons.\n\n\"Lindegaard and beqiri have been dating since 2012.\"\n\nYes, the article says they've been dating since 2012.\n\nSo, all the facts in the summary are correct. However, the consistency score given is 3. Maybe because the summary is too brief and misses some key points, like their son, his struggles at Manchester United, or his third-choice status. But the summary doesn't include any incorrect information. It just omits some details. So, perhaps the score is 3 because it's somewhat consistent but not fully comprehensive.\n\nWait, but the evaluation criteria for consistency is about truthfulness, not completeness. So, if the summary doesn't add any false information, it's consistent. But maybe the way it's phrased is a bit off. For example, \"tied the swedish model\" could be a bit awkward, but it's still accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the summary is too short, but as long as it doesn't have any inaccuracies, it should be scored higher. Hmm, perhaps the score is 3 because it's somewhat consistent but could be better. Maybe the evaluator felt it was missing important details, but consistency is about accuracy, not thoroughness.\n\nI think the summary is accurate, so consistency should be 5. But the given score is 3. Maybe the evaluator thought it was inconsistent because it's too brief, but that's more about completeness rather than consistency. So, perhaps the score is lower than it should be.\n\nBut according to the instructions, consistency is about truthfulness, not completeness. So, if the summary doesn't have any false information, it's consistent. Therefore, the score should be 5. However, the given score is 3, so maybe the evaluator had a different perspective.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the summary has some minor inaccuracies. Let me check again.\n\nThe summary says \"tied the swedish model last year.\" The article says he tied the knot with the Swedish model last year. So, that's correct.\n\n\"Manchester united goalkeeper has made just 19 league appearances.\" Correct.\n\n\"Lindegaard and beqiri have been dating since 2012.\" Correct.\n\nSo, all points are accurate. Therefore, the consistency should be 5. But the given score is 3. Maybe the evaluator considered the summary too brief, but that's not a consistency issue. So, perhaps the score is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the summary has some grammatical issues or awkward phrasing, but that doesn't affect consistency. Consistency is about factual accuracy, not language quality.\n\nTherefore, I think the consistency score should be 5, but the given score is 3. So, perhaps the evaluator made a mistake.\n</think>\n\nThe summary accurately reflects the key facts from the source article without introducing any inaccuracies. It correctly states that Anders Lindegaard married Misse Beqiri, the number of league appearances he has made, and the duration of their relationship. Therefore, the summary is consistent with the original text.\n\n**Consistency: 5**",

Therefore, the summary is consistent with the original text.\n\n**Consistency: 5**\nReprompt and Regrade: \nThank you for your initial evaluation!\n\nTo help you arrive at a final score that more closely aligns with human expert judgment, we have constructed a 90% confidence interval for this task using conformal prediction based on your past scoring records. This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [4.00, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",

It correctly states that Anders Lindegaard married Misse Beqiri, the number of league appearances he has made, and the duration of their relationship.

Kevin Rebbie , 56 , of Limerick Township , faces several charges , including aggravated indecent assault , unlawful contact with a minor , sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy , the Montgomery County District Attorney 's Office said . The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March , according to prosecutors . She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep . She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13 , Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her , according to Philly.com . Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom , 34 of which showed victims as they showered . Rebbie uploaded the videos , some that included close-up images of children 's genitalia , to his computer to view later , prosecutors said . The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period , according to prosecutors . Rebbie admitted to filming several victims , including other juveniles , but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered , according to the Pottstown Mercury . ' I think it 's particularly horrific ... and particularly for a young child when they think they 're in the sanctity of their home , going through their teenage years , to be violated in the way that this young woman was violated it just goes beyond the boundaries of horrific . It 's just unfathomable , ' Limerick Police Chief William Albany told the Mercury . The relationship between Rebbie and the girl 's family is unknown . Rebbie 's preliminary hearing is on May 1 and he is being held on a $ 500,000 bail .",

    "judge": "4\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the consistency of the summary based on the source article. The score given is 4, but I need to determine if that's accurate or if it should be higher or lower.\n\nFirst, I'll read the source article carefully to understand the main points. The article details the arrest of Kevin Rebbie, 56, from Limerick Township, Pennsylvania. He was arrested after a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera in her bathroom, which police traced back to him. The investigation started in March when the girl discovered the camera under the sink. She reported that Rebbie had been watching her for years, particularly when she was undressing and believed to be asleep. Additionally, she mentioned that Rebbie molested her from when she was nine until she was 13. The police found 41 videos from the camera, 34 of which showed victims showering, including close-ups of children's genitalia. Rebbie admitted to filming several victims, including other juveniles, but specifically targeted the 15-year-old girl. The article also mentions the charges he faces and his upcoming hearing.\n\nNow, looking at the summary: It states that Rebbie was arrested after the girl found the camera, which police traced back to him. It mentions the investigation began in March when the girl found the camera under the sink. She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and believed she was asleep. \n\nComparing the summary to the article, the summary accurately captures the main points: arrest, discovery of the camera, the girl's account of Rebbie watching her. However, the summary omits several critical details. It doesn't mention the duration of the abuse (four years), the fact that Rebbie molested the girl from age nine to thirteen, the number of videos found, the explicit content of the videos, or the charges he faces. These omissions don't introduce false information but do leave out significant facts.\n\nThe consistency score is about how truthful the summary is, not about completeness. Since the summary doesn't fabricate any details and accurately reflects the facts it includes, it's consistent. However, it's somewhat incomplete. But since the criteria don't penalize for omitting details as long as they don't misrepresent, the score of 4 seems appropriate. Maybe a 5 would require including all critical details, but the summary is still truthful without misleading.\n</think>\n\nThe summary accurately reflects the key facts from the source article without introducing any false information.

This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [4.00, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",
    "judge": "4\n\n**Explanation:**\nAfter reviewing the confidence interval [4.00, 5.00], I remain confident in the original score of 4. The summary accurately reflects the main points without introducing false information, though it omits some critical details. Since the criteria don't penalize for omissions as long as they don't misrepresent, a score of 4 is appropriate. The interval suggests a 90% chance the expert score falls within 4-5, and given the summary's truthfulness, 4 remains the most accurate score.",
