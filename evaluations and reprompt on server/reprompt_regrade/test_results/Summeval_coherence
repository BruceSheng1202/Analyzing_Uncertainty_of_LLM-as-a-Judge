This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [1.33, 3.67]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",

Kevin Rebbie , 56 , of Limerick Township , faces several charges , including aggravated indecent assault , unlawful contact with a minor , sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy , the Montgomery County District Attorney 's Office said . The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March , according to prosecutors . She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep . She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13 , Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her , according to Philly.com . Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom , 34 of which showed victims as they showered . Rebbie uploaded the videos , some that included close-up images of children 's genitalia , to his computer to view later , prosecutors said . The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period , according to prosecutors . Rebbie admitted to filming several victims , including other juveniles , but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered , according to the Pottstown Mercury . ' I think it 's particularly horrific ... and particularly for a young child when they think they 're in the sanctity of their home , going through their teenage years , to be violated in the way that this young woman was violated it just goes beyond the boundaries of horrific . It 's just unfathomable , ' Limerick Police Chief William Albany told the Mercury . The relationship between Rebbie and the girl 's family is unknown . Rebbie 's preliminary hearing is on May 1 and he is being held on a $ 500,000 bail .\n\nSummary:\n\nKevin rebbie , 56 , of limerick township , pennsylvania , was arrested after a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera in her bathroom that police were able to trace back to the man .

This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [3.00, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3.

This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [3.00, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",

Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1.

Mr Weston told Daily Mail Australia the dog belonged to the local bike shop 's owner . Scroll down for video The large croc proudly held on to its catch for hours as it lurked around the Puerto Vallarta marina , in Mexico 'There 's a sanctuary for these crocodiles up the river ( 200m away ) which runs out to the sea and the marina , ' Mr Weston explained . 'The dog went to the water 's edge to see the crocodile ( being curious I guess ) but things did n't go according to plan obviously . 'It was certainly a shock to the system . Guess that 's nature though , ' he said . In the video the beast glides through the water , with rocks on one side and a footpath on the other , as crowds gasp in amazement .

This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [1.33, 3.67]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",

The fires were started in southeastern siberia , by farmers burning grass in their fields .\n\nEvaluation Form (Only provide your coherence score from 1-5):\n\nCoherence:\nInitial response: \n 3\n</think>\n\nCoherence: 3\nReprompt and Regrade: \nThank you for your initial evaluation!\n\nTo help you arrive at a final score that more closely aligns with human expert judgment, we have constructed a 90% confidence interval for this task using conformal prediction based on your past scoring records. This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [1.67, 4.67]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",
