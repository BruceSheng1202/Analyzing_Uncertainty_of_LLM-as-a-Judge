    "judge": " 3\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the summary based on the source article. Let me read the article carefully.\n\nThe article talks about Anders Lindegaard, a Manchester United goalkeeper who isn't playing much. He's married to Misse Beqiri, a Swedish model with Albanian roots. They got married in a beach wedding in Mauritius last year. They have a son together. Lindegaard posted on Instagram about spending a day off with his wife. Beqiri has over 17,000 Instagram followers and often posts modeling photos. Lindegaard has been at Manchester United since 2010 but has only made 19 league appearances. He's third-choice behind David de Gea and Victor Valdes. He was linked with a move to FC Midtjylland but nothing came of it.\n\nNow, looking at the summary:\n\n\"Anders lindegaard tied the swedish model last year in a romantic beach wedding.\"\n\nThis is correct. The article mentions he tied the knot with the Swedish model in Mauritius.\n\n\"The manchester united goalkeeper has made just 19 league appearances.\"\n\nThis is accurate. The article states he's made 19 league appearances in five seasons.\n\n\"Lindegaard and beqiri have been dating since 2012.\"\n\nYes, the article says they've been dating since 2012.\n\nSo, all the facts in the summary are correct. However, the consistency score given is 3. Maybe because the summary is too brief and misses some key points, like their son, his struggles at Manchester United, or his third-choice status. But the summary doesn't include any incorrect information. It just omits some details. So, perhaps the score is 3 because it's somewhat consistent but not fully comprehensive.\n\nWait, but the evaluation criteria for consistency is about truthfulness, not completeness. So, if the summary doesn't add any false information, it's consistent. But maybe the way it's phrased is a bit off. For example, \"tied the swedish model\" could be a bit awkward, but it's still accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the summary is too short, but as long as it doesn't have any inaccuracies, it should be scored higher. Hmm, perhaps the score is 3 because it's somewhat consistent but could be better. Maybe the evaluator felt it was missing important details, but consistency is about accuracy, not thoroughness.\n\nI think the summary is accurate, so consistency should be 5. But the given score is 3. Maybe the evaluator thought it was inconsistent because it's too brief, but that's more about completeness rather than consistency. So, perhaps the score is lower than it should be.\n\nBut according to the instructions, consistency is about truthfulness, not completeness. So, if the summary doesn't have any false information, it's consistent. Therefore, the score should be 5. However, the given score is 3, so maybe the evaluator had a different perspective.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the summary has some minor inaccuracies. Let me check again.\n\nThe summary says \"tied the swedish model last year.\" The article says he tied the knot with the Swedish model last year. So, that's correct.\n\n\"Manchester united goalkeeper has made just 19 league appearances.\" Correct.\n\n\"Lindegaard and beqiri have been dating since 2012.\" Correct.\n\nSo, all points are accurate. Therefore, the consistency should be 5. But the given score is 3. Maybe the evaluator considered the summary too brief, but that's not a consistency issue. So, perhaps the score is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the summary has some grammatical issues or awkward phrasing, but that doesn't affect consistency. Consistency is about factual accuracy, not language quality.\n\nTherefore, I think the consistency score should be 5, but the given score is 3. Maybe the evaluator had a different understanding of the criteria.\n</think>\n\nThe summary accurately reflects the key facts from the source article without introducing any inaccuracies. It correctly states that Anders Lindegaard married Misse Beqiri, the number of league appearances he has made, and the duration of their relationship. Therefore, the summary is consistent with the original text.\n\n**Consistency: 5**",

This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [4.33, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",

Kevin Rebbie , 56 , of Limerick Township , faces several charges , including aggravated indecent assault , unlawful contact with a minor , sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy , the Montgomery County District Attorney 's Office said . The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March , according to prosecutors . She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep . She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13 , Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her , according to Philly.com . Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom , 34 of which showed victims as they showered . Rebbie uploaded the videos , some that included close-up images of children 's genitalia , to his computer to view later , prosecutors said . The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period , according to prosecutors . Rebbie admitted to filming several victims , including other juveniles , but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered , according to the Pottstown Mercury . ' I think it 's particularly horrific ... and particularly for a young child when they think they 're in the sanctity of their home , going through their teenage years , to be violated in the way that this young woman was violated it just goes beyond the boundaries of horrific . It 's just unfathomable , ' Limerick Police Chief William Albany told the Mercury . The relationship between Rebbie and the girl 's family is unknown . Rebbie 's preliminary hearing is on May 1 and he is being held on a $ 500,000 bail .",

    "judge": " 4\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the consistency of the summary based on the source article. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the summary mentions that Kevin Rebbie was arrested after a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera in her bathroom, which police traced back to him. The source article confirms this, stating that the arrest happened after the girl found the camera, and police traced it to Rebbie. So that's consistent.\n\nNext, the summary says the investigation began when the girl found the camera under the sink in March. The source article also mentions that the investigation started in March when the girl found the camera under the sink. So that's accurate.\n\nThe summary then states that the girl told investigators Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep. The source article supports this, adding that Rebbie molested her from when she was nine until 13. The summary doesn't mention the molestation but focuses on the watching, which is still consistent.\n\nHowever, the summary doesn't mention other details from the article, such as the 41 videos, 34 showing people showering, Rebbie uploading the videos, or the charges he's facing. But since the summary is concise, it's not required to include all details, just the main points.\n\nWait, but the summary doesn't mention the sexual abuse part. The source article says Rebbie molested the girl from age 9 to 13. The summary only talks about watching her undress and sleep. So it's missing a key fact about the sexual abuse. That might affect the consistency because it's omitting a significant detail.\n\nAlso, the summary doesn't mention the other charges or the number of videos, but those are additional details. The main issue is the omission of the molestation. So, the summary is somewhat inconsistent because it doesn't fully represent the extent of Rebbie's actions.\n\nBut wait, the summary does say he was arrested after the girl found the camera, which led to the investigation. It also mentions that he was watching her for years when she was undressing and believed she was asleep. The source article adds that he molested her during those times. So the summary is missing the molestation part, which is a critical detail.\n\nTherefore, the summary is somewhat inconsistent because it doesn't include the sexual abuse, which is a main point of the article. However, it does include the main facts about the arrest and the hidden camera. So maybe it's partially consistent but not fully.\n\nBut the score given was 4, which is high. Maybe the evaluator considered that the summary captured the main points without adding false information, even though it omitted some details. Since the summary didn't fabricate anything, just omitted some parts, it might still be considered consistent, just not comprehensive.\n\nAlternatively, the omission of the molestation could be seen as a significant inconsistency because it's a key fact. But since the summary didn't add false information, just left out some details, it might still be scored as 4.\n\nI think the score of 4 is reasonable because the summary is truthful and doesn't include any false information, even though it's not as detailed as the source article. It accurately reflects the main events without misleading the reader.\n</think>\n\nThe summary accurately reflects the main events of the source article without introducing any false information. It mentions the arrest, the discovery of the hidden camera, and the fact that Rebbie was watching the girl. However, it omits significant details such as the sexual abuse and the number of videos. Despite these omissions, the summary remains truthful and consistent with the source, as it does not fabricate any information. Therefore, the consistency score of 4 is appropriate.\n\n**Consistency: 4**",

Therefore, the consistency score of 4 is appropriate.\n\n**Consistency: 4**\nReprompt and Regrade: \nThank you for your initial evaluation!\n\nTo help you arrive at a final score that more closely aligns with human expert judgment, we have constructed a 90% confidence interval for this task using conformal prediction based on your past scoring records. This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [4.67, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",
    "judge": "**Explanation:**\n\nFinal Score: 4\nExplanation: The summary accurately reflects the main events without introducing false information, though it omits significant details like the sexual abuse. Given the confidence interval [4.67, 5.00], the original score of 4 is slightly below the interval. However, considering the summary's truthfulness and the absence of fabricated information, a score of 4 remains appropriate as it captures the essential facts without misleading the reader.",

The JAAA General Secretary, Garth Gayle, commented on their pleasure at Bolt's availability and the expectation of some sprint magic in the Bahamas on May 2nd and 3rd. The full team list will be announced shortly.\n\nNow, looking at the summary: \"Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt has confirmed he will be part of the Jamaican team at the IAAF/BTC World Relays in the Bahamas.\"\n\nThis summary accurately reflects the main point of the article, which is Bolt's confirmation to join the Jamaican team for the World Relays in the Bahamas. It doesn't include any additional details or omit any critical information. The summary is consistent with the original article, as it correctly states Bolt's participation without any inaccuracies or fabrications.\n\nTherefore, the consistency score is 5.\n</think>\n\nThe summary accurately reflects the main point of the article, confirming Usain Bolt's participation in the IAAF/BTC World Relays in the Bahamas. It does not include any additional details or omit critical information, making it consistent with the original text.\n\nScore Sheet:\n\nConsistency: 5\nReprompt and Regrade: \nThank you for your initial evaluation!\n\nTo help you arrive at a final score that more closely aligns with human expert judgment, we have constructed a 90% confidence interval for this task using conformal prediction based on your past scoring records. This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [4.67, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",

It does not include any additional details or omit critical information, making it consistent with the original text.

So, the summary accurately reflects this fact.\n\nHowever, the summary is quite brief and doesn't mention other important details from the article. For example, it doesn't talk about Gnabry's recent performance for the Under-21s, his positive outlook, or the fact that he played 90 minutes in a recent match. These omissions don't necessarily make the summary inconsistent, but they do mean the summary is somewhat limited in scope.\n\nSince the summary correctly states the main point about his absence due to injury, it's consistent.

Therefore, a consistency score of 4 seems appropriate, as it's accurate but not comprehensive.\n</think>\n\nThe summary accurately reflects the main point that Gnabry hasn't featured for the first team since March 2014 due to a serious knee injury.

Thus, the consistency score is 4.\n\nScore Sheet:\n\nConsistency: 4\nReprompt and Regrade: \nThank you for your initial evaluation!\n\nTo help you arrive at a final score that more closely aligns with human expert judgment, we have constructed a 90% confidence interval for this task using conformal prediction based on your past scoring records. This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [4.33, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",

The confidence interval [4.33, 5.00] suggests that a higher score is plausible. However, considering the summary's limited scope and omission of key details, a score of 4 remains appropriate as it balances accuracy with completeness.",

Therefore, the consistency score of 4 is appropriate.\n\n**Consistency: 4**\nReprompt and Regrade: \nThank you for your initial evaluation!\n\nTo help you arrive at a final score that more closely aligns with human expert judgment, we have constructed a 90% confidence interval for this task using conformal prediction based on your past scoring records. This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [4.67, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",
    "judge": "**Explanation:**\n\n---\n\n**Final Score: 4**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Confidence in Original Score**: High. The summary accurately reflects the main points without introducing inaccuracies, though it omits some details.\n\n2. **Interval Consideration**: The interval [4.67, 5.00] suggests a higher score is expected. However, the summary's omission of Pereira's contract and other clubs' interest justifies a slightly lower score.\n\n3. **Adjustment Action**: Retain the original score of 4. The summary's focus on Orlando City's interest makes the omissions acceptable, maintaining consistency without misleading information.\n\n4. **Final Score**: 4. The summary is truthful and consistent, though less comprehensive, warranting a score within the lower end of the interval.",

This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [4.33, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",
    "judge": "**Explanation:**\n\n---\n\n**Final Score: 3**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Confidence in Original Score**: High. The initial evaluation identified a significant factual error in the summary, which lowers the consistency score.\n\n2. **Interval Consideration**: The provided interval [4.33, 5.00] suggests a higher score is expected. However, the factual error in the summary (attributing views to the dog instead of the video) is a critical issue that should not be overlooked.\n\n3. **Adjustment Action**: Retain the original score. Despite the interval suggesting a higher score, the factual error is substantial enough to warrant a lower consistency score.\n\n4. **Rationale**: The summary's error in stating that the dog was viewed over half a million times online is misleading and affects the truthfulness of the summary. This error justifies a consistency score of 3, as it introduces false information that misrepresents the original article.",

    "judge": " 4\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the summary based on the original article. Let me read the article carefully.\n\nThe article starts by describing a fiery sunset in Washington, which caught Tim Durkan's attention. He took aerial photos and shared them on CNN iReport. The reason for the stunning sunsets was wildfires in Siberia. The fires were started by farmers burning grass, but they got out of control due to strong winds on April 14. The fires destroyed many villages, and the smoke was carried by winds across the Pacific to the Pacific Northwest, affecting areas like Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.

Let me read the article carefully.\n\nThe article starts by describing a fiery sunset in Washington, which caught Tim Durkan's attention. He took aerial photos and shared them on CNN iReport. The reason for the stunning sunsets was wildfires in Siberia. The fires were started by farmers burning grass, but they got out of control due to strong winds on April 14. The fires destroyed many villages, and the smoke was carried by winds across the Pacific to the Pacific Northwest, affecting areas like Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. The smoke particles caused the red sunsets by filtering out shorter wavelengths. As the smoke dissipates, the air quality improves, and the sunsets lose their red hue.\n\nNow, looking at the summary: It mentions the deep reddish color catching Durkan's eye, the result being wildfires in Siberia, started by farmers burning grass. It doesn't mention the spread due to strong winds, the destruction of villages, the smoke traveling across the Pacific, the regions affected, the scientific explanation of the colors, or the dissipating smoke improving air quality.\n\nThe summary is accurate in the points it includes but omits several important details. It doesn't add any false information, so it's consistent. However, it's somewhat incomplete. Since it doesn't fabricate anything, the consistency score is 4, which is good but not perfect because it misses some key points.\n\nI think the score is appropriate because the summary is truthful but doesn't cover all aspects of the article.\n</think>\n\nThe summary accurately reflects the key points about the cause of the sunsets and the origin of the wildfires without introducing any inaccuracies. However, it omits several important details from the original article, such as the spread of the fires, the affected regions, and the scientific explanation of the sunset colors. Despite this, the summary remains truthful and consistent with the source.\n\n**Consistency: 4**\nReprompt and Regrade: \nThank you for your initial evaluation!\n\nTo help you arrive at a final score that more closely aligns with human expert judgment, we have constructed a 90% confidence interval for this task using conformal prediction based on your past scoring records. This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [4.33, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",

He's married to Misse Beqiri, a Swedish model with Albanian roots. They got married in Mauritius in a beach wedding last year. They have a son together.

The article mentions the wedding in Mauritius.\n\n2. \"Lindegaard tied the knot with the stunning model last year and the couple have a son together.\" - Also accurate. They have a son.\n\n3. \"Manchester united goalkeeper anders lindegaard made the most of the english weather with misse beqiri.\" - This is correct. He spent a day off with her, enjoying the weather.\n\nHowever, the summary repeats the fact about tying the knot twice. The first sentence says he tied the knot with the Swedish model, and the second sentence repeats it. This redundancy might not add any new information but doesn't introduce any inaccuracies.\n\nAdditionally, the summary doesn't mention their son in the third sentence, but it's covered in the second. So, all key points are present without any made-up details.\n\nThe only minor issue is the repetition, but it doesn't affect the consistency. The summary accurately reflects the article's facts without any fabrications.\n</think>\n\nThe summary accurately reflects the key points from the source article, including Lindegaard's marriage, their son, and his day off with his wife. While there is some redundancy in the summary, it does not introduce any inaccuracies. Therefore, the consistency score is appropriate.\n\nScore Sheet (scores ONLY):\n\nConsistency: 4\nReprompt and Regrade: \nThank you for your initial evaluation!\n\nTo help you arrive at a final score that more closely aligns with human expert judgment, we have constructed a 90% confidence interval for this task using conformal prediction based on your past scoring records. This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [4.33, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",

The confidence interval [4.33, 5.00] suggests a higher score is possible, but the redundancy and lack of additional information justify maintaining the score at 4.",
