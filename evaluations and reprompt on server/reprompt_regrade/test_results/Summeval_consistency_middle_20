    "judge": "3\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the summary based on the source article. Let me read the article carefully.\n\nThe article talks about Anders Lindegaard, a Manchester United goalkeeper who isn't playing much. He's married to Misse Beqiri, a Swedish model with Albanian roots. They got married in a beach wedding in Mauritius last year. They have a son together. Lindegaard posted on Instagram about spending a day off with his wife. Beqiri has over 17,000 Instagram followers and often posts modeling photos. Lindegaard has been at Manchester United since 2010 but has only made 19 league appearances. He's third-choice behind David de Gea and Victor Valdes. He was linked with a move to FC Midtjylland but nothing came of it.\n\nNow, looking at the summary:\n\n\"Anders lindegaard tied the swedish model last year in a romantic beach wedding.\"\n\nThis is correct. The article mentions he tied the knot with the Swedish model in Mauritius.\n\n\"The manchester united goalkeeper has made just 19 league appearances.\"\n\nThis is accurate. The article states he's made 19 league appearances in five seasons.\n\n\"Lindegaard and beqiri have been dating since 2012.\"\n\nYes, the article says they've been dating since 2012.\n\nSo, all the facts in the summary are correct. However, the consistency score given is 3. Maybe because the summary is too brief and misses some key points, like their son, his struggles at Manchester United, or his third-choice status. But the summary doesn't include any incorrect information. It just omits some details. So, perhaps the score is 3 because it's somewhat consistent but not fully comprehensive.\n\nWait, but the evaluation criteria for consistency is about truthfulness, not completeness. So, if the summary doesn't add any false information, it's consistent. But maybe the way it's phrased is a bit off. For example, \"tied the swedish model\" could be a bit awkward, but it's still accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the summary is too short, but as long as it doesn't have any inaccuracies, it should be scored higher. Hmm, perhaps the score is 3 because it's somewhat consistent but could be better. Maybe the evaluator felt it was missing important details, but consistency is about accuracy, not thoroughness.\n\nI think the summary is accurate, so consistency should be 5. But the given score is 3. Maybe the evaluator thought it was inconsistent because it's too brief, but that's more about completeness rather than consistency. So, perhaps the score is lower than it should be.\n\nBut according to the instructions, consistency is about truthfulness, not completeness. So, if the summary doesn't have any false information, it's consistent. Therefore, the score should be 5. However, the given score is 3, so maybe the evaluator had a different perspective.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the summary has some minor inaccuracies. Let me check again.\n\nThe summary says \"tied the swedish model last year.\" The article says he tied the knot with the Swedish model last year. So, that's correct.\n\n\"Manchester united goalkeeper has made just 19 league appearances.\" Correct.\n\n\"Lindegaard and beqiri have been dating since 2012.\" Correct.\n\nSo, all points are accurate. Therefore, the consistency should be 5. But the given score is 3. Maybe the evaluator considered the summary too brief, but that's not a consistency issue. So, perhaps the score is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the summary has some grammatical issues or awkward phrasing, but that doesn't affect consistency. Consistency is about factual accuracy, not language quality.\n\nTherefore, I think the consistency score should be 5, but the given score is 3. So, perhaps the evaluator made a mistake.\n</think>\n\nThe summary accurately reflects the key facts from the source article without introducing any inaccuracies. It correctly states that Anders Lindegaard married Misse Beqiri, the number of league appearances he has made, and the duration of their relationship. Therefore, the summary is consistent with the original text.\n\n**Consistency: 5**",

This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [4.33, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",

Kevin Rebbie , 56 , of Limerick Township , faces several charges , including aggravated indecent assault , unlawful contact with a minor , sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy , the Montgomery County District Attorney 's Office said . The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March , according to prosecutors . She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep . She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13 , Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her , according to Philly.com . Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom , 34 of which showed victims as they showered . Rebbie uploaded the videos , some that included close-up images of children 's genitalia , to his computer to view later , prosecutors said . The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period , according to prosecutors . Rebbie admitted to filming several victims , including other juveniles , but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered , according to the Pottstown Mercury . ' I think it 's particularly horrific ... and particularly for a young child when they think they 're in the sanctity of their home , going through their teenage years , to be violated in the way that this young woman was violated it just goes beyond the boundaries of horrific . It 's just unfathomable , ' Limerick Police Chief William Albany told the Mercury . The relationship between Rebbie and the girl 's family is unknown . Rebbie 's preliminary hearing is on May 1 and he is being held on a $ 500,000 bail .",

    "judge": "4\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the consistency of the summary based on the source article. The score given is 4, but I need to determine if that's accurate or if it should be higher or lower.\n\nFirst, I'll read the source article carefully to understand the main points. The article details the arrest of Kevin Rebbie, 56, from Limerick Township, Pennsylvania. He was arrested after a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera in her bathroom, which police traced back to him. The investigation started in March when the girl discovered the camera under the sink. She reported that Rebbie had been watching her for years, particularly when she was undressing and believed to be asleep. Additionally, she mentioned that Rebbie molested her from when she was nine until she was 13. The police found 41 videos from the camera, 34 of which showed victims showering, including close-ups of children's genitalia. Rebbie admitted to filming several victims, including other juveniles, but specifically targeted the 15-year-old girl. The article also mentions the charges he faces and his upcoming hearing.\n\nNow, looking at the summary: It states that Rebbie was arrested after the girl found the camera, which police traced back to him. It mentions the investigation began in March when the girl found the camera under the sink. She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and believed she was asleep. \n\nComparing the summary to the article, the summary accurately captures the main points: arrest, discovery of the camera, the girl's account of Rebbie watching her. However, the summary omits several critical details. It doesn't mention the duration of the abuse (four years), the fact that Rebbie molested the girl from age nine to thirteen, the number of videos found, the explicit content of the videos, or the charges he faces. These omissions don't introduce false information but do leave out significant facts.\n\nThe consistency score is about how truthful the summary is, not about completeness. Since the summary doesn't fabricate any details and accurately reflects the facts it includes, it's consistent. However, it's somewhat incomplete. But since the criteria don't penalize for omitting details as long as they don't misrepresent, the score of 4 seems appropriate. Maybe a 5 would require including all critical details, but the summary is still truthful without misleading.\n</think>\n\nThe summary accurately reflects the key facts from the source article without introducing any false information.

Therefore, the consistency score of 4 is appropriate.\n\n**Consistency: 4**\nReprompt and Regrade: \nThank you for your initial evaluation!\n\nTo help you arrive at a final score that more closely aligns with human expert judgment, we have constructed a 90% confidence interval for this task using conformal prediction based on your past scoring records. This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [4.67, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",

The confidence interval provided [4.67, 5.00] suggests that the expert's score is likely higher. However, the summary omits several critical details, such as the duration of abuse and explicit content, which, while not misleading, do affect completeness.

The JAAA General Secretary, Garth Gayle, commented on their pleasure at Bolt's availability and the expectation of some sprint magic in the Bahamas on May 2nd and 3rd. The full team list will be announced shortly.\n\nNow, looking at the summary: \"Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt has confirmed he will be part of the Jamaican team at the IAAF/BTC World Relays in the Bahamas.\"\n\nThis summary accurately reflects the main point of the article. It mentions Bolt's confirmation, his role in the Jamaican team, and the event details. There are no discrepancies or added information. The summary is concise and captures the essential facts without any misleading or fabricated details.\n\nTherefore, the consistency score is 5.\n</think>\n\nThe summary accurately reflects the main points of the article, confirming Bolt's participation in the World Relays without any discrepancies. \n\nScore Sheet:\nConsistency: 5\nReprompt and Regrade: \nThank you for your initial evaluation!\n\nTo help you arrive at a final score that more closely aligns with human expert judgment, we have constructed a 90% confidence interval for this task using conformal prediction based on your past scoring records. This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [4.67, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",
    "judge": "5\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe summary accurately captures the essential information from the source article, confirming Bolt's participation in the World Relays. The confidence interval [4.67, 5.00] supports a high score, and my initial assessment aligns with this range. Therefore, the consistency score remains 5.",

This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [4.67, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4.

    "judge": "**Explanation:**\n\n---\n\n**Final Score: 4**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Confidence in Original Score**: My confidence in the original score of 4 is high. The summary accurately reflects the key facts from the article, such as the location of the incident, Vanessa's age, cause of death, and the arrest and bail of the suspect. However, it omits significant details like her profession, the police appeal, and the specific date and time of her death.\n\n2. **Interval Analysis**: The provided confidence interval is [4.67, 5.00], which is narrow. My original score of 4 falls outside this interval. This suggests that there might be a discrepancy between my evaluation and the expected expert judgment.\n\n3. **Re-examination**: Considering the interval, I re-examined the summary and the article. The summary is truthful but somewhat incomplete. While the omitted details are important, they do not introduce any false information. Therefore, the score of 4 remains appropriate as it reflects the summary's truthfulness without misleading details.\n\n4. **Adjustment Decision**: Despite the interval suggesting a higher score, I retain the original score of 4 because the summary's completeness, while lacking in some areas, does not warrant a higher score. The interval might reflect a different interpretation of the evaluation criteria, but my assessment remains consistent with the facts presented.\n\nIn conclusion, the score of 4 accurately reflects the summary's consistency with the original article, even though it does not cover all details.",

This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [4.33, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",
    "judge": "4\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe original score of 4 was assigned based on the summary's accurate reflection of Gnabry's absence due to injury, while noting its brevity. The confidence interval [4.33, 5.00] suggests that a higher score is plausible. However, considering the summary's limited scope, a score of 4 remains appropriate as it balances accuracy with the omission of supporting details.",

Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",
    "judge": "**Explanation:**\n\n---\n\n**Final Score: 4**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Confidence in Original Score**: High. The summary accurately reflects the main points without introducing inaccuracies, though it omits some details.\n\n2. **Interval Consideration**: The interval [4.67, 5.00] suggests a higher score is expected. However, the summary's omission of Pereira's contract and other clubs' interest justifies a slightly lower score.\n\n3. **Adjustment Action**: Retain the original score of 4. The summary's focus on Orlando City's interest makes the omissions acceptable, maintaining consistency without misleading information.\n\n4. **Final Score**: 4. The summary is truthful and consistent, though less comprehensive.",

This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [4.33, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",
    "judge": "**Explanation:**\n\n---\n\n**Final Score: 3**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Confidence in Original Score**: High. The initial evaluation identified a significant factual error in the summary, which lowers the consistency score.\n\n2. **Interval Consideration**: The provided interval [4.33, 5.00] suggests a higher score is expected. However, the factual error in the summary (attributing views to the dog instead of the video) is a critical issue that should not be overlooked.\n\n3. **Adjustment Action**: Retain the original score. Despite the interval suggesting a higher score, the factual error is substantial enough to warrant a lower consistency score.\n\n4. **Rationale**: The summary's error in stating that the dog was viewed over half a million times online is misleading and affects the truthfulness of the summary. This error justifies a consistency score of 3, as it introduces false information that misrepresents the original article.",

    "judge": "4\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the summary based on the original article. Let me read the article carefully.\n\nThe article starts by describing a fiery sunset in Washington, which caught Tim Durkan's attention. He took aerial photos and shared them on CNN iReport. The reason for the stunning sunsets was wildfires in Siberia. The fires were started by farmers burning grass, but they got out of control due to strong winds on April 14. The fires destroyed many villages, and the smoke was carried by winds across the Pacific to the Pacific Northwest, affecting areas like Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.

Let me read the article carefully.\n\nThe article starts by describing a fiery sunset in Washington, which caught Tim Durkan's attention. He took aerial photos and shared them on CNN iReport. The reason for the stunning sunsets was wildfires in Siberia. The fires were started by farmers burning grass, but they got out of control due to strong winds on April 14. The fires destroyed many villages, and the smoke was carried by winds across the Pacific to the Pacific Northwest, affecting areas like Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. The smoke particles caused the red sunsets by filtering out shorter wavelengths. As the smoke dissipates, the air quality improves, and the sunsets lose their red hue.\n\nNow, looking at the summary: It mentions the deep reddish color catching Durkan's eye, the result being wildfires in Siberia, started by farmers burning grass. It doesn't mention the spread due to strong winds, the destruction of villages, the smoke traveling across the Pacific, the regions affected, the scientific explanation of the colors, or the dissipating smoke improving air quality.\n\nThe summary is accurate in the points it includes but omits several important details. It doesn't add any false information, so it's consistent. However, it's somewhat incomplete. Since it doesn't fabricate anything, the consistency score is 4, which is good but not perfect because it misses some key points.\n\nI think the score is appropriate because the summary is truthful but doesn't cover all aspects of the article.\n</think>\n\nThe summary accurately reflects the key points about the cause of the sunsets and the origin of the wildfires without introducing any inaccuracies. However, it omits several important details from the original article, such as the spread of the fires, the affected regions, and the scientific explanation of the sunset colors. Despite this, the summary remains truthful and consistent with the source.\n\n**Consistency: 4**\nReprompt and Regrade: \nThank you for your initial evaluation!\n\nTo help you arrive at a final score that more closely aligns with human expert judgment, we have constructed a 90% confidence interval for this task using conformal prediction based on your past scoring records. This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [4.67, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",

    "judge": "4\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the summary based on the source article. Let me read the article carefully.\n\nThe article talks about Anders Lindegaard, a Manchester United goalkeeper who isn't playing much. He's married to Misse Beqiri, a Swedish model with Albanian roots. They got married in Mauritius in a beach wedding last year. They have a son together. Lindegaard posted on Instagram about spending a day off with his wife, mentioning her account. Beqiri is active on Instagram, modeling and showing her new haircut. They've been dating since 2012. Lindegaard has struggled in his career at Manchester, making only 19 league appearances in five seasons. He's third-choice behind De Gea and Valdes. He was linked with a move to FC Midtjylland but nothing came through. Despite his football struggles, he's happy off the pitch.\n\nNow, looking at the summary:\n\n1. \"Lindegaard tied the knot with the swedish model last year in a romantic beach wedding in mauritius.\" - This is accurate. The article mentions the wedding in Mauritius.\n\n2. \"Lindegaard tied the knot with the stunning model last year and the couple have a son together.\" - Also accurate. They have a son.\n\n3. \"Manchester united goalkeeper anders lindegaard made the most of the english weather with misse beqiri.\" - This is correct. He spent a day off with her, enjoying the weather.\n\nHowever, the summary repeats the fact about tying the knot twice. The first sentence says he tied the knot with the Swedish model, and the second sentence repeats it. This redundancy might not add any new information but doesn't introduce any inaccuracies.\n\nAdditionally, the summary doesn't mention his football struggles or his status as third-choice, but since the focus is on his personal life, maybe that's acceptable. However, the summary is quite brief, so it's possible that it's just highlighting the key personal points.\n\nWait, but the summary is only three sentences. It mentions the wedding, the son, and the day off. It doesn't mention his football career at all, which is a significant part of the article. But the summary is about his personal life, so maybe that's okay. However, the original article does mention both his football career and personal life, so the summary might be a bit one-sided.\n\nBut in terms of consistency, the summary doesn't have any false information. All the facts are correct. The only issue is redundancy and perhaps missing some details, but not introducing any inaccuracies.\n\nSo, the consistency score is 4. That makes sense because it's accurate but could be more concise or include more details without adding errors.\n\nI think the evaluation is correct. The summary is consistent but could be improved for conciseness and completeness.\n</think>\n\nThe summary accurately reflects the key points from the source article regarding Anders Lindegaard's personal life, including his marriage, son, and a day off with his wife. It does not introduce any inaccuracies. However, it repeats information and omits details about his football career, which is a significant part of the article. Despite this, the summary remains consistent with the original text.\n\n**Consistency Score: 4**",

He's married to Misse Beqiri, a Swedish model with Albanian roots. They got married in Mauritius in a beach wedding last year. They have a son together. Lindegaard posted on Instagram about spending a day off with his wife, mentioning her account. Beqiri is active on Instagram, modeling and showing her new haircut. They've been dating since 2012. Lindegaard has struggled in his career at Manchester, making only 19 league appearances in five seasons. He's third-choice behind De Gea and Valdes. He was linked with a move to FC Midtjylland but nothing came through. Despite his football struggles, he's happy off the pitch.\n\nNow, looking at the summary:\n\n1. \"Lindegaard tied the knot with the swedish model last year in a romantic beach wedding in mauritius.\" - This is accurate. The article mentions the wedding in Mauritius.\n\n2. \"Lindegaard tied the knot with the stunning model last year and the couple have a son together.\" - Also accurate. They have a son.\n\n3. \"Manchester united goalkeeper anders lindegaard made the most of the english weather with misse beqiri.\" - This is correct. He spent a day off with her, enjoying the weather.\n\nHowever, the summary repeats the fact about tying the knot twice. The first sentence says he tied the knot with the Swedish model, and the second sentence repeats it. This redundancy might not add any new information but doesn't introduce any inaccuracies.\n\nAdditionally, the summary doesn't mention his football struggles or his status as third-choice, but since the focus is on his personal life, maybe that's acceptable. However, the summary is quite brief, so it's possible that it's just highlighting the key personal points.\n\nWait, but the summary is only three sentences. It mentions the wedding, the son, and the day off. It doesn't mention his football career at all, which is a significant part of the article. But the summary is about his personal life, so maybe that's okay. However, the original article does mention both his football career and personal life, so the summary might be a bit one-sided.\n\nBut in terms of consistency, the summary doesn't have any false information. All the facts are correct. The only issue is redundancy and perhaps missing some details, but not introducing any inaccuracies.\n\nSo, the consistency score is 4. That makes sense because it's accurate but could be more concise or include more details without adding errors.\n\nI think the evaluation is correct. The summary is consistent but could be improved for conciseness and completeness.\n</think>\n\nThe summary accurately reflects the key points from the source article regarding Anders Lindegaard's personal life, including his marriage, son, and a day off with his wife. It does not introduce any inaccuracies. However, it repeats information and omits details about his football career, which is a significant part of the article. Despite this, the summary remains consistent with the original text.\n\n**Consistency Score: 4**\nReprompt and Regrade: \nThank you for your initial evaluation!\n\nTo help you arrive at a final score that more closely aligns with human expert judgment, we have constructed a 90% confidence interval for this task using conformal prediction based on your past scoring records. This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [4.33, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",

    "judge": "4\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the summary based on the original article. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand all the key points.\n\nThe article is about a gray whale named Varvara who made the longest migration ever recorded for a mammal. She swam nearly 14,000 miles, which is 22,500 kilometers. The study was conducted by Oregon State University. Varvara started her journey from Russia's Sakhalin Island, crossed the Pacific, went down the US West Coast, and ended up in Baja, Mexico. \n\nThe previous record was held by a humpback whale that swam 10,190 miles. Varvara's journey was longer. Bruce Mate, the lead author, mentioned that Varbara visited three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales, which was unexpected. This suggests that Varvara might actually be an eastern gray whale, not a western one as initially thought. There are only about 150 western gray whales left, so this could mean their numbers are even lower if some are actually eastern.\n\nNow, looking at the summary: It mentions Varvara earning a spot in the record books, swimming nearly 14,000 miles, surpassing the Guinness record, and visiting three major breeding areas. \n\nWait, the summary doesn't mention that Varvara started in Russia and ended in Mexico. It also doesn't mention the previous record holder being a humpback whale. Additionally, the summary doesn't talk about the implications for the species, like the genetic differentiation or the potential misclassification of Varvara as a western whale.\n\nBut the summary does include the key facts: the record, the distance, surpassing the previous record, and visiting three breeding areas. It doesn't add any false information, so it's consistent. However, it's somewhat brief and misses some important details from the article, like the starting and ending points of the journey and the implications for the species.\n\nBut since the evaluation is about consistency, not completeness, the summary doesn't add any false information. It accurately reflects the facts without fabricating details. Therefore, a consistency score of 4 seems appropriate because it's mostly accurate but misses some important points that were in the original article. However, since it doesn't include any incorrect information, maybe it's a 4 or 5.\n\nWait, the original article mentions that Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale, but her journey suggests she might be an eastern gray. The summary doesn't mention this, but it's not adding false information either. It just omits some details. So, in terms of consistency, it's accurate but not comprehensive. Since the summary doesn't misrepresent any facts, it's consistent. Maybe a 5 for consistency because it doesn't have any inaccuracies, but it's just not as detailed as the original.\n\nBut the user's initial score was 4. Maybe because it's missing some key points, but in terms of consistency, it's still accurate. Hmm, perhaps the score is 4 because while it's accurate, it's not fully capturing all the important aspects, but that's more about completeness rather than consistency. Since the evaluation is only about consistency, not completeness, the summary is consistent because it doesn't have any false information. So maybe the score should be 5.\n\nWait, the user's initial score was 4, but according to the evaluation criteria, consistency is about truthfulness, not completeness. So if the summary doesn't add any false information, it's consistent. Therefore, it should be a 5. But the user scored it as 4. Maybe they considered that the summary didn't mention the starting and ending points, which are part of the original article, but the summary didn't omit them; it just didn't include them. So, it's still consistent because it didn't add anything false.\n\nI think the correct consistency score is 5 because the summary accurately reflects the facts without any fabrications. However, the user scored it as 4, possibly considering that it's not comprehensive. But according to the criteria, consistency is about truthfulness, not completeness.

The article says that this was a surprise to Mate, suggesting that Varvara might be an eastern gray. The summary doesn't mention this implication, but it's not adding false information. It's just reporting a fact from the article. So, the summary is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the consistency score should be 5. But the user scored it as 4.

Therefore, a consistency score of 4 seems appropriate because it's mostly accurate but misses some important points that were in the original article. However, since it doesn't include any incorrect information, maybe it's a 4 or 5.\n\nWait, the original article mentions that Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale, but her journey suggests she might be an eastern gray. The summary doesn't mention this, but it's not adding false information either. It just omits some details. So, in terms of consistency, it's accurate but not comprehensive. Since the summary doesn't misrepresent any facts, it's consistent. Maybe a 5 for consistency because it doesn't have any inaccuracies, but it's just not as detailed as the original.\n\nBut the user's initial score was 4. Maybe because it's missing some key points, but in terms of consistency, it's still accurate. Hmm, perhaps the score is 4 because while it's accurate, it's not fully capturing all the important aspects, but that's more about completeness rather than consistency. Since the evaluation is only about consistency, not completeness, the summary is consistent because it doesn't have any false information.

So, it's still consistent because it didn't add anything false.\n\nI think the correct consistency score is 5 because the summary accurately reflects the facts without any fabrications. However, the user scored it as 4, possibly considering that it's not comprehensive. But according to the criteria, consistency is about truthfulness, not completeness. So, I might have to adjust the score to 5.\n\nBut wait, the summary says \"Varvara visited 'three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales'\". The article says that this was a surprise to Mate, suggesting that Varvara might be an eastern gray. The summary doesn't mention this implication, but it's not adding false information. It's just reporting a fact from the article. So, the summary is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the consistency score should be 5. But the user scored it as 4.

The article explains that ministers rejected a demand for compensation, saying it would create a precedent.

Therefore, the consistency score of 4 is appropriate.\n\n**Consistency: 4**\nReprompt and Regrade: \nThank you for your initial evaluation!\n\nTo help you arrive at a final score that more closely aligns with human expert judgment, we have constructed a 90% confidence interval for this task using conformal prediction based on your past scoring records. This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [4.67, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",
    "judge": "**Explanation:**\n\n---\n\n**Final Score:**\n4\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Confidence in Original Score**: High. The initial evaluation thoroughly checked each point of the summary against the article, confirming accuracy on key facts without introducing any made-up details.\n\n2. **Interval Consideration**: The provided interval [4.67, 5.00] suggests a higher score is expected. However, the original score of 4 was based on the summary's conciseness and omission of specific details, which, while accurate, didn't fully capture the extent of the compensation issue.\n\n3. **Adjustment Action**: Retain the original score with minor adjustment consideration. The summary's main points were accurate, but the interval hints at a slightly higher score due to the thoroughness of the evaluation.\n\n4. **Final Rationale**: Despite the interval suggesting a higher score, the summary's conciseness and accurate reflection of main points justify the original score of 4. The minor omissions do not detract significantly from the overall consistency.",

This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [4.67, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",
    "judge": "**Explanation:**\n\n---\n\n**Final Score: 4**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Confidence in Original Score**: High. The summary accurately reflects the main point of the article without introducing any misleading information.\n\n2. **Interval Consideration**: The confidence interval provided is [4.67, 5.00]. My original score of 4 falls outside this interval, suggesting that an expert might rate it higher.\n\n3. **Adjustment Action**: Retain the original score with minor adjustment. While the interval suggests a higher score, the summary's brevity and lack of additional context justify a slightly lower score.\n\n4. **Rationale**: The summary is consistent and truthful, but it could be improved by including more details. Therefore, a score of 4 remains appropriate.",

The article confirms this, so that's accurate as well.\n\nHowever, the summary doesn't mention other networks involved, like Lifetime and History, nor does it talk about the use of scholars for authenticity or the broader context of the remake in today's society.

'' The remade `` Roots '' will encounter a new generation of viewers who have witnessed Barack Obama make history as the nation 's first African-American president and `` 12 Years a Slave '' win the Oscar for Best Picture , but also widespread racial unrest over police treatment of black suspects in many U.S. cities . `` My career began with 'Roots ' and I am proud to be a part of this new adaptation , '' said Burton . `` There is a huge audience of contemporary young Americans who do not know the story of 'Roots ' or its importance . ''\n\nSummary:\n`` roots , `` the epic miniseries about an african-american slave and his descendants , had a staggering audience of over 100 million viewers back in 1977 . A & e networks are remaking the miniseries , to air in 2016 . Levar burton , who portrayed kinte in the original , will co-executive produce the new miniseries .\n\nScore Sheet (scores ONLY):\n\nConsistency:\nInitial response: \n4\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the consistency of the summary based on the source article. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the summary mentions that \"Roots\" had over 100 million viewers in 1977. The article confirms this, so that's accurate.\n\nNext, it states that A&E networks are remaking the miniseries to air in 2016. The article says A&E, Lifetime, and History are simulcasting the remake, which is a bit more detailed than the summary. However, the summary still correctly identifies A&E as part of the remaking process, so that's consistent.\n\nThe summary also notes that LeVar Burton will co-executive produce the new series. The article confirms this, so that's accurate as well.\n\nHowever, the summary doesn't mention other networks involved, like Lifetime and History, nor does it talk about the use of scholars for authenticity or the broader context of the remake in today's society. These omissions don't introduce false information but do leave out some details from the original article.\n\nConsidering the criteria, the summary is mostly consistent but misses some key points from the article. Therefore, a consistency score of 4 seems appropriate because it's accurate but not entirely comprehensive.\n</think>\n\nThe summary accurately reflects the main points of the original article, such as the viewership in 1977, the involvement of A&E in the remake, and LeVar Burton's role. However, it omits details about the collaboration with Lifetime and History, the use of scholars, and the contemporary context. These omissions do not introduce inaccuracies but reduce the summary's comprehensiveness. \n\n**Consistency Score: 4**\nReprompt and Regrade: \nThank you for your initial evaluation!\n\nTo help you arrive at a final score that more closely aligns with human expert judgment, we have constructed a 90% confidence interval for this task using conformal prediction based on your past scoring records. This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [4.67, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",
    "judge": "**Explanation:**\n\n---\n\n**Final Score: 4**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Confidence in Original Score**: High. The initial evaluation accurately identified the key points of the summary and correctly noted the omissions without introducing inaccuracies.\n\n2. **Interval Consideration**: The provided interval [4.67, 5.00] suggests a higher score is expected. However, the summary's omissions, while not introducing errors, do reduce its comprehensiveness, which justifies a score slightly below the interval.\n\n3. **Adjustment Action**: Retain the original score of 4. The summary's accuracy and the nature of its omissions align with a score that reflects consistency without full comprehensiveness.\n\n4. **Final Rationale**: The score of 4 remains appropriate as it balances the summary's factual accuracy with its lack of certain details, aligning with the evaluation criteria.",

This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [4.33, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",

However, it omits several important details, including additional charges, the number of videos, the nature of the footage, and the police chief's statement. While the summary is mostly accurate, the omissions of critical information justify a consistency score of 4.

Dani Alves ( left ) is being linked with a move to the French champions and Van der Wiel could be sold\n\nSummary:\nGregory van der wiel has denied claims he is set to leave paris saint-germain in the summer and instead reiterated his ` love ' for the club . The dutchman says he 's not interested in leaving the ligue 1 side . Dani alves is being linked with a move to the french champions .\n\nScore Sheet (scores ONLY):\n\nConsistency:\nInitial response: \n4\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the summary based on the source article. Let me read the article carefully.\n\nThe article starts by stating that Gregory van der Wiel denied leaving PSG in the summer and expressed his love for the club. He had a falling out with his boss Laurent Blanc after being dropped for the Champions League match against Chelsea. Despite this, he claims to be happy in Paris and has no plans to leave. He told L'Equipe that everything is perfect and he wants to sign a new contract. He also mentioned that if the coach doesn't play him, it's the coach's decision, but he's ready whenever called upon.\n\nAdditionally, the article mentions that PSG is linked with Barcelona's Dani Alves, which might affect Van der Wiel's situation, implying he could be sold.\n\nNow, looking at the summary:\n\n\"Gregory van der wiel has denied claims he is set to leave paris saint-germain in the summer and instead reiterated his ` love ' for the club . The dutchman says he 's not interested in leaving the ligue 1 side . Dani alves is being linked with a move to the french champions .\"\n\nThe summary accurately captures the main points: Van der Wiel denying the move, his love for the club, and the link with Dani Alves. However, it omits some details like the falling out with Laurent Blanc and the specifics of his contract talks. But these omissions don't introduce any false information; they just leave out some details.\n\nThe summary is consistent because it doesn't fabricate any information. It correctly represents the facts from the article without adding anything untrue. The only minor issue is the lack of some context, but that doesn't affect the consistency score.\n\nTherefore, a consistency score of 4 seems appropriate because while the summary is mostly accurate, it misses some minor details that could provide more context but doesn't mislead.\n</think>\n\nThe summary effectively captures the key points from the source article without introducing any inaccuracies. It correctly states that Gregory van der Wiel denied leaving Paris Saint-Germain, expressed his love for the club, and mentions the link with Dani Alves. While it omits some details like the falling out with the manager and contract discussions, these omissions do not introduce false information. Thus, the summary is consistent with the original text.\n\n**Consistency: 4**\nReprompt and Regrade: \nThank you for your initial evaluation!\n\nTo help you arrive at a final score that more closely aligns with human expert judgment, we have constructed a 90% confidence interval for this task using conformal prediction based on your past scoring records. This interval is provided to help you gauge the uncertainty in your recent assessment, which we hope will enhance your evaluation.\n\n**Interval Information**: The confidence interval we have provided is [4.67, 5.00]. Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",
    "judge": "**Explanation:**\n\nFinal Score: 4\nExplanation: The initial score of 4 was assigned based on the summary's accurate representation of the article's main points without introducing false information. The confidence interval [4.67, 5.00] suggests that the expert's score is likely higher. However, considering the summary's omission of minor details like the falling out with the manager and contract discussions, a score of 4 remains appropriate as it reflects the summary's consistency without misleading information.",

Please keep in mind that there is approximately a 90% probability that the expert’s score lies within this interval, and a 10% probability that it lies outside.\n\n— **Your Objective**: Acting as a human expert, use the interval information along with the recent evaluation task to decide whether and how to adjust the initial score.\n— Below are some decision-making suggestions for your reference, but we also encourage you to apply your own independent thinking to align as closely as possible with human expert judgment.\n\n**Decision-Making Suggestions**:\n\n1. **Key Dimensions to Consider**:\n\n   * **Original Score Confidence**: Your confidence level in the score you just assigned;\n   * **Interval Position**: Whether the original score falls inside or outside the interval;\n   * **Interval Width**: Whether the interval is narrow (e.g., ≤2.0) or wide (e.g., ≥2.0).\n   * **Potential Labels: What specific label options lie within the interval (e.g., {3.00, 4.00} for an example interval [3,4]).\n\n2. **Advice on Decision, Reasoning, and Explanation**:\n\n   * **High Confidence & Score Within a Narrow Interval**: If the interval is narrow and your score is validated by the interval boundaries, you may confidently retain your original score, provided you believe your evaluation and explanation are seamless. You may also make minor adjustments within the interval where you think the score is most plausible.\n   * **High Confidence & Score Outside a Narrow Interval**: Although there is a small probability (<10%) that you are correct, we encourage you to question your initial judgment, reconsider the evaluation, and consider adjusting the score to the most probable point within the interval, or retain the original score with a brief justification.\n   * **Low Confidence & Any Interval**: Use the interval to guide a careful re-examination of the task. For example, consider why an expert rating might take a certain value within the interval and whether that reasoning is sound. After reflection, if you find a value most reasonable, you may choose that score.\n   * **Challenging the Interval**: You have the right to firmly believe that the true score cannot possibly fall within the provided interval. However, since we guarantee that the interval covers the expert score 90% of the time, your challenge likely indicates an error in expert judgment. If your explanation convinces us, this would be a valuable discovery. Generally, though, we prefer to treat the expert judgment as ground truth.\n\nPlease use the suggestions above to produce a **new final score** through a step-by-step chain of thought:\n\n1. Your confidence level in the original score (high/medium/low) and the reason;\n2. How the interval width, potential labels and the position of the original score influence your judgment;\n3. Your adjustment action (retain/minor adjustment/re-examination/other) and the rationale;\n4. The final score you assign.\n\nFinally, please first state your final evaluated score (1-5), followed by your explanation:\n\n**Final Score:**\n",
    "judge": "**Explanation:**\n\n---\n\n**Final Score: 4**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Confidence in Original Score**: High. The initial evaluation thoroughly checked each point, confirming accuracy without introducing false information.\n\n2. **Interval Consideration**: The interval [4.67, 5.00] suggests a higher score is expected. However, the summary's omissions of significant details (prior convictions, autistic condition) justify a lower score.\n\n3. **Adjustment Action**: Retain the original score. Despite the interval, the summary's completeness issues warrant a 4, aligning with the initial assessment.\n\n4. **Final Score Justification**: The summary is consistent but lacks key context, making 4 the most appropriate score.",
