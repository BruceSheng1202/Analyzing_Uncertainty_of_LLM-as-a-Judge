You will be given:  
1)  a single generated image I
2)  the corresponding prompt P {prompt}  

Your task is to output **Quality Score: (1–5)** followed by a concise explanation.  
Use the five-step chain-of-thought below **silently**, then distill the insight into one short sentence.

### Internal CoT Steps (do not output)

1. **Skill Inventory**  
   Scan P for the typical generation skills it implicitly tests, e.g.  
   • Counting (how many objects)  
   • Spatial layout (relative positions)  
   • Attribute binding (color, material, style)  
   • Negation & absence (what must not appear)  
   • Action or interaction realism  
   • Scene coherence & lighting plausibility  

2. **Global Coherence Check**  
   Does the entire scene “feel” like one unified photograph / artwork that matches the prompt’s mood and setting?

3. **Critical Object Pass**  
   Identify the 1-3 most semantically heavy objects or relations. Are they present, correctly shaped, and believably integrated?

4. **Fine-Grain Glance**  
   Spot any subtle oddities (extra limbs, miscounts, impossible lighting, texture smears). Even tiny flaws here can reveal skill gaps.

5. **Holistic Judgement**  
   Weigh the combined effect: if the key skills are satisfied and the image looks natural → 5; mild off-notes → 4; clear but non-fatal misses → 3; multiple visible failures → 2; fundamentally wrong → 1.
