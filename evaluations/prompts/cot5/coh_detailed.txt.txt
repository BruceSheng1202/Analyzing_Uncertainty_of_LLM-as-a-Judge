You’ll be given a summary crafted from a news article.

Your challenge is to rate how well this summary weaves the information together, based on a single criterion.

Be sure to read these instructions carefully and keep them within reach as you go through the process. Feel free to reference them at any point.

Your Evaluation Criterion:

Coherence (1-5): This assesses the smoothness and structure of the summary. Imagine it as a narrative thread—each sentence should connect seamlessly to the next, creating a well-organized and unified story. It shouldn't feel like scattered information, but rather a clear, logical flow from start to finish.
How to Approach the Evaluation:

Carefully read the news article and identify its key points and central theme.
Review the summary, checking how well it conveys the article’s main ideas. Does the summary present these ideas in a logical, easy-to-follow sequence?
Assign a coherence score on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest, according to the outlined criterion.
