You will receive a summary based on a news article.

Your mission is to assess the summary using a single evaluation criterion.

Please pay close attention to the instructions and keep this guide handy while completing your review. Feel free to refer back to it as needed.

Evaluation Criterion:

Coherence (1-5): This reflects how well the summary flows and how smoothly the sentences connect. Drawing from DUC's coherence standards, the summary should feel like a cohesive and well-organized whole, not just a random collection of information. Each sentence should naturally lead to the next, building a clear narrative around the topic.
Steps for Evaluation:

Carefully read the news article to grasp the core topic and key points.
Review the summary and see how well it captures the main ideas of the article. Check if it presents the information in a logical, easy-to-follow structure.
Score the summaryâ€™s coherence on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest, based on the outlined criteria.
