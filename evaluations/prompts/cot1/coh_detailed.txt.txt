You will receive a summary of a news article.

Your task is to evaluate the summary based on a specific criterion.

Please read these instructions carefully and keep this document open for reference during the evaluation process.

Evaluation Criterion:

Coherence (1-5) â€“ This refers to how well the sentences in the summary flow together. We align this with the DUC guideline on structure and coherence, which states: "The summary should be well-structured and organized, building from sentence to sentence to form a coherent piece of information on the topic, rather than just being a collection of related facts."

Evaluation Process:

Carefully read the news article to identify its main topic and key points.
Compare the summary to the article. Check if the summary includes the main topic and key points and whether it presents them in a clear and logical order.
Rate coherence on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest, according to the given criterion.
