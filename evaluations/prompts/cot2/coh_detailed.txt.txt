You will be provided with a summary of a news article.

Your task is to evaluate the summary based on a specific criterion.

Please read and follow the instructions carefully. Keep this document open during the evaluation process, referring to it as necessary.

Evaluation Criterion:

Coherence (1-5): This measures the overall quality and flow of the sentences. Similar to the DUC's coherence guidelines, the summary should be well-structured and logically organized. It should present information cohesively rather than as a disjointed collection of facts.
Evaluation Process:

Thoroughly read the news article and identify its main topic and key points.
Review the summary and compare it to the article. Ensure that the summary addresses the main topic and key points in a clear, logical manner.
Rate the summaryâ€™s coherence on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest, based on the provided criterion.
