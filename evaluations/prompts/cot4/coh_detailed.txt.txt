You’ll be presented with a summary derived from a news article.

Your task? To evaluate how well this summary holds together using one key measure.

Make sure to read these instructions thoroughly and keep them at your side as you proceed. Feel free to revisit them as often as needed.

The Evaluation Criterion:

Coherence (1-5): This measures the smoothness and logical flow of the summary. Think of it like crafting a well-stitched narrative. The summary should be more than just a list of facts—it should form a clear, organized account of the topic, where each sentence builds naturally on the previous one, creating a unified whole.
How to Evaluate:

Read through the news article and pinpoint its main topic and key ideas.
Carefully examine the summary. Does it accurately capture the article’s core points? Is the information laid out in a way that makes sense, with ideas flowing logically from one to the next?
Rate the summary’s coherence on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 represents the lowest score and 5 the highest, using the above criterion.
